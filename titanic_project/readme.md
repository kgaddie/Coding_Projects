## Project: Titanic Project

### Description
This project outlines the work done to solve and present a solution to the Kaggle "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" competition. The goal of this competition is to use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. 

The selected language for this project was Python, broken up in to a series of Jupyter Notebooks outlining the various components of the project: EDA, Model Building, and Model Evaluation.

### Files Included

##### Data
Included in this section is a data folder where the training and test datasets provided by Kaggle were provided

##### EDA.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook outlines the EDA of the base Titanic Dataset provided in the Kaggle Competition. Included in this notebook is missing data analysis, feature analysis, and other key components of EDA.

##### Model_Build.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook contains the various selected models used for solving this effort. Included methods are Decision Tree Modeling, Random Forest Modeling, and XGBoost.

##### Model_Evaluation.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook processes the results of the models tested in the Model_Build notebook and demonstrates means for evaluating model accuracy and efficiency. At the end of the notebook, a recommended method is identified for solving the Titanic Survivor Classification Problem and performance results are demonstrated.
