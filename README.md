## Projects
### Curling Statistics
This project involves the compilation of data from curling matches in the form of scoreboard results and the resultant dataframe of analytics provided by team. The calculations included inside will enable users/teams to see the trends in a variety of important aspects of the game, including (but not limited to): hammer efficiency, steal efficiency, steal defense efficiency, and average points scored aggregated by opponents, season, and in total overall performance history.

### Reference Scripts
Scripts contained in this folder are for use for future code projects and serve as functional references for interacting with data.

### Titanic Project
This project outlines the work done to solve and present a solution to the Kaggle "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" competition. The goal of this competition is to use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. 

The selected language for this project was Python, broken up in to a series of Jupyter Notebooks outlining the various components of the project: EDA, Model Building, and Model Evaluation.

### Whisky Data
This project involves Web Scraping and use of Geolocation Data to gather a list of all Whisky Distilleries in the world, searching and assigning geolocation coordinates (latitude/longitude by address or country), and compiling into a base dataset for ingestion into a Tableau Dashboard
